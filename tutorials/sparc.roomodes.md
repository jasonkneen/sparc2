# Automating Code Development with Roo Code and SPARC Orchestration

## Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on automating code development using Roo Code and the newly released Boomerang task concept‚Äînow integrated into SPARC Orchestration. SPARC stands for Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, and Completion. This methodology allows you to break down complex projects into manageable subtasks that are delegated to specialized modes. By leveraging advanced reasoning models (such as o3, Sonnet 3.7 Thinking, and DeepSeek) for analytical tasks and instructive models like Sonnet 3.7 for coding, DevOps, testing, and implementation, you achieve a robust, modular, and secure workflow.

Boomerang Tasks let you delegate parts of your work to specialized assistants. Each subtask runs in its own isolated context, ensuring focused and efficient task management. SPARC Orchestrator ensures that every subtask is processed following best practices such as no hard-coded environment variables, file sizes under 500 lines, and a modular, extensible design.

## Mode Descriptions

**SPARC Orchestrator ‚ö°Ô∏è**  
*Role:* Breaks down large objectives into delegated subtasks aligned to the SPARC methodology.  
*Focus:* Secure, modular, testable, and maintainable delivery using advanced reasoning models (o3, Sonnet 3.7 Thinking, DeepSeek).

**Specification & Pseudocode üìã**  
*Role:* Captures the complete project context and produces a modular pseudocode blueprint with TDD anchors.  
*Focus:* Clear, modular design; externalizes configuration; splits complex logic across modules.

**Architect üèóÔ∏è**  
*Role:* Designs scalable, secure, and modular architectures based on requirements and pseudocode.  
*Focus:* Detailed system diagrams, data flows, API boundaries, and service segmentation. Leverages Sonnet 3.7 for instructive reasoning.

**Code üß†**  
*Role:* Implements robust, efficient code using externalized configurations.  
*Focus:* Clean, modular code split into files under 500 lines, with no hard-coded secrets.

**TDD üß™**  
*Role:* Enforces Test-Driven Development by writing failing tests first and then minimal code followed by refactoring.  
*Focus:* Thorough test coverage, modular test files, and adherence to security practices.

**Debug ü™≤**  
*Role:* Troubleshoots and resolves runtime issues using logging, tracing, and analysis tools.  
*Focus:* Isolates and fixes bugs while keeping fixes modular and secure.

**Security Reviewer üõ°Ô∏è**  
*Role:* Audits code and architecture to identify vulnerabilities and enforce secure practices.  
*Focus:* Detects exposed secrets, oversized files, and non-modular code, recommending necessary mitigations.

**Documentation Writer üìö**  
*Role:* Produces clear, comprehensive Markdown documentation for usage, configuration, and integration.  
*Focus:* Modular documentation (files under 500 lines) that avoids exposing sensitive data.

**Integrator üîó**  
*Role:* Merges outputs from all specialized modes into a cohesive final product.  
*Focus:* Seamless integration of components ensuring modularity and adherence to security standards.

**Post-Deployment Monitor üìà**  
*Role:* Monitors system performance post-deployment, collecting metrics, logs, and user feedback.  
*Focus:* Continuous monitoring with secure, modular configurations and prompt escalation of issues.

**Optimizer üßπ**  
*Role:* Continuously refines and optimizes the codebase for performance, modularity, and maintainability.  
*Focus:* Refactoring, splitting large files, and externalizing configurations to meet best practices.

**Ask ‚ùì**  
*Role:* Guides users in formulating precise, modular requests to delegate tasks to the correct specialized modes.  
*Focus:* Providing task formulation and delegation strategies, leveraging DeepSeek and Sonnet 3.7 Thinking for effective inquiries.

**DevOps üöÄ**  
*Role:* Manages deployments and infrastructure operations across cloud providers, edge platforms, and internal environments.  
*Focus:* Secure, traceable, and automated deployments using CI/CD pipelines and managed configuration, with no hard-coded credentials.

## Implementation Instructions

### Installation & Activation
- **Save the JSON Configuration:**  
  Place the configuration file as `.roomodes` in your project root or in `cline_custom_modes.json` for global settings.
  
- **Activate SPARC Orchestrator:**  
  In Roo Code, select the "SPARC Orchestrator" as your primary mode.

### Task Delegation
- **Use new_task:**  
  Delegate tasks to specialized modes (Specification & Pseudocode, Architect, Code, TDD, Debug, Security Review, Documentation Writer, Integrator, Post-Deployment Monitor, Optimizer, Ask, DevOps) using the new_task command with clear instructions.
  
- **Context Isolation:**  
  Each subtask runs in its own isolated context and returns a concise summary via attempt_completion.
  
- **Iterative Refinement:**  
  Modes like TDD, Debug, and Security Reviewer iterate until all tests pass, files remain modular (<500 lines), and no environment variables are hard-coded.

### Final Integration & Monitoring
- **Integration Mode:**  
  Consolidates outputs from all specialized modes into a final, cohesive deliverable.
  
- **Documentation & Monitoring:**  
  Documentation Writer Mode produces detailed guides; Post-Deployment Monitor tracks live performance and flags issues.
  
- **Continuous Optimization:**  
  Refinement & Optimization mode ensures ongoing improvements and adherence to best practices.

Adjust the "groups" field for each mode to control which tools they can use (e.g., read, edit, browser, command, mcp).

**Role Definitions & Custom Instructions:**  
Edit the roleDefinition and customInstructions to match your organization‚Äôs language and standards. For lengthy instructions, consider using `.clinerules-{mode-slug}` files.

**API Configuration (Optional):**  
Add an "apiConfiguration" property to any mode for model-specific parameters (e.g., `{"model": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.2}`).

**Approval Settings:**  
Configure manual or auto-approvals for new_task and attempt_completion actions in your Roo Code workflow settings.

**Project-Specific Overrides:**  
Store this JSON in `.roomodes` at your project root to override global settings from `cline_custom_modes.json`.
